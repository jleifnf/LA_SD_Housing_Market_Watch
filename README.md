## Project Goal: Evaluate the housing market in San Diego and Los Angeles in California. 
Utilizing various statistical methods in an effort to analyze Californiaâ€™s housing shortage, considering the effect of time on the market for housing in LA and SD county. In most cases, homes are sold faster if their price is below the original listing value. We will measure evaluate the effectiveness of lowering the listing price by calculating Price Cut Ratio, the difference in the closing price and the listing price.

      What is the difference in the statistical and realistic impact?
 - If the ToM is < 60 days, what is the effect on Closing Price vs Listing Price?
